## Common usage example

A simple example that should run as-is to showcase the main usage loop (*flask and python3 required*)

```sh
# create a simple flask server daemon in a file named "FLASK_SERVER"
cat << EOT >> FLASK_SERVER
#!/usr/bin/python3
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def index():
  return {"status": 200}

if __name__ == "__main__":
  app.run()
EOT

# make the file executable
chmod +x FLASK_SERVER

# start the process from an executable file
eggsecutor hatch FLASK_SERVER
> Hatching process "FLASK_SERVER" and starting to track...
> egg hatched, tracking process with pid: "3670"

# check the process is healthy
eggsecutor list
> Process name    pid     status
> -----------------------------------
> FLASK_SERVER    3670    Running

# once ready shut down the server by name (or pid)
# the following are equivalent
eggsecutor stop FLASK_SERVER
eggsecutor stop 3670
> stopping process with pid: 3670

# or, if you want to stop ALL running processes being tracked
eggsecutor clear
```

# Customization

By design, `eggsecutor` is meant to be a low-maintenance (and therefore, low-option) tool.

The only user-defined variable is the location of the JSON state tracking file, which defaults to

`~/.eggsecutor.state`



If need be, this path can be overwritten by setting the `EGGSECUTOR_STATE_FILE` environment variable to a valid file path (if the path does not exist, it will be created upon first usage).
